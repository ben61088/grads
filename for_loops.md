# Write a Javascript for loop to print the following to the console:

* The natural numbers up 10:
    1
    2
    3
    ...
    9
    10

*   The natural numbers up to 9, including 0:
    0
    1
    2
    3
    ...
    8
    9

* The natural numbers from 1 to 10 in reverse:
    10
    9
    8
    ...
    2
    1

*   "a"
    "aa"
    "aaa"
    "aaaa"
    ...
    "aaaaaaaa"

* The sums of the first 10 natural numbers, i.e.
    1
    3
    6
    10
    15
    ...
    55
    since 1+2=3, 1+2+3=6, 1+2+3+4=10 and 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10=55

* A loop that prints the first 21 natural numbers but replaces each one with "fizz" if the number is divisible by 3, "buzz" if it    divisible by 5 and "fizzbuzz" if it is divisible by both:
    1
    2
    "fizz"
    4
    "buzz"
    "fizz"
    7
    8
    "fizz"
    "buzz"
    11
    "fizz"
    13
    14
    "fizzbuzz"
    ...
    17
    "fizz"
    19
    "buzz"
    "fizzbuzz"

* Write a function prod that takes an integer as input and prints the product of its digits
    e.g.
    prod(123) = 1*2*3 = 6
    prod(329) = 3*2*9 = 54
    prod(23) = 2*3

*   1
    22
    333
    4444
    55555
